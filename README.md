# Object Detection with OpenCV and SSD MobileNet v3

Detects and labels everyday objects (people, cars, dogs, cups and 76 other COCO classes) in **images and live webcam video**, using a pretrained **SSD MobileNet v3** model loaded through OpenCV's DNN module.

## How it works

1. Loads the frozen TensorFlow graph (`frozen_inference_graph.pb`) and its config (`.pbtxt`) into `cv2.dnn_DetectionModel`.
2. Resizes each frame to 320×320, normalizes pixels to [-1, 1] and swaps BGR→RGB to match the model's training input.
3. Keeps detections above a 50% confidence threshold and draws a bounding box and COCO label for each one.

## Run it

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

python code.py path/to/photo.jpg   # detect objects in an image
python code.py                      # live detection from your webcam (press q to quit)
```
